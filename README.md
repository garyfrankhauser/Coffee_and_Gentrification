# Coffee_and_Gentrification
Web Visualizer 
Rough Draft of Web Visualizer
The theory is that coffee shops are the first sign of gentrification. This application is intended to show coffee shops as they appear in the city of San Diego and then have the ability to watch as San Diego zip codes then increase in value in the years following the openings of those coffee shops.

Unfortunately, unable to obtain enough data in order to have a fully funtioning application.
